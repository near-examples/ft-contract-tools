This repository contains an example implementation of a [fungible token](https://docs.near.org/primitives/ft/standard) contract in Rust which uses [near-sdk-contract-tools](https://github.com/near/near-sdk-contract-tools).

## How to Build Locally?

Install [`cargo-near`](https://github.com/near/cargo-near) and run:

```bash
cargo near build
```

## How to Test Locally?

```bash
cargo test
```

## How to Deploy?

To deploy manually, install [`cargo-near`](https://github.com/near/cargo-near) and run:

```bash
# Create a new account
cargo near create-account <contract-account-id> --useFaucet

# Deploy the contract on it
cargo near deploy <contract-account-id>

# Initialize the contract
near call <contract-account-id> new '{}' --accountId <contract-account-id>
```

## Basic methods
```bash
# Mint to owner
near contract call-function as-transaction <contract-account-id> mint json-args '{"amount": "100000"}' prepaid-gas '100.0 Tgas' attached-deposit '0.0025 NEAR' sign-as <contract-account-id> network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send

# Burn owner's tokens
near contract call-function as-transaction <contract-account-id> burn json-args '{"amount":"1"}' prepaid-gas '100.0 Tgas' attached-deposit '0 NEAR' sign-as <contract-account-id> network-config testnet sign-with-keychain send

# View metadata
near view <contract-account-id> ft_metadata

# Make a storage deposit
near call <contract-account-id> storage_deposit '' --accountId <account-id> --amount 0.0025

# View balance
near view <contract-account-id> ft_balance_of '{"account_id": "<account-id>"}'

# Transfer tokens
near call <contract-account-id> ft_transfer '{"receiver_id": "<account-id>", "amount": "19"}' --accountId <contract-account-id> --amount 0.000000000000000000000001
```

## Notes

 - The maximum balance value is limited by U128 (`2**128 - 1`).
 - JSON calls should pass U128 as a base-10 string. E.g. "100".
 - This does not include escrow functionality, as `ft_transfer_call` provides a superior approach. An escrow system can, of course, be added as a separate contract or additional functionality within this contract.
